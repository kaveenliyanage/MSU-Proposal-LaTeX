  abstract = {A transformation technique is presented to minimize soil brightness influences from spectral vegetation indices involving red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. Graphically, the transformation involves a shifting of the origin of reflectance spectra plotted in NIR-red wavelength space to account for first-order soil-vegetation interactions and differential red and NIR flux extinction through vegetated canopies. For cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. var DPI-70) and range grass (Eragrosticslehmanniana Nees) canopies, underlain with different soil backgrounds, the transformation nearly eliminated soil-induced variations in vegetation indices. A physical basis for the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) is subsequently presented. The SAVI was found to be an important step toward the establishment of simple °lobal” that can describe dynamic soil-vegetation systems from remotely sensed data.},

This article explores the performance of combining linear support vector machines with various feature ranking methods, and reports the experiments conducted when participating the Causality Challenge. Experiments show that a feature ranking using weights from linear SVM models yields good performances, even when the training and testing data are not identically distributed. Checking the difference of Area Under Curve (AUC) with and without removing each feature also gives similar rankings. Our study indicates that linear SVMs with simple feature rankings are effective on data sets in the Causality Challenge.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present Deep Graph Kernels, a unified framework to learn latent representations of sub-structures for graphs, inspired by latest advancements in language modeling and deep learning. Our framework leverages the dependency information between sub-structures by learning their latent representations. We demonstrate instances of our framework on three popular graph kernels, namely Graphlet kernels, Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernels, and Shortest-Path graph kernels. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets show that Deep Graph Kernels achieve significant improvements in classification accuracy over state-of-the-art graph kernels.},

When it comes to texts, one of the most  common representations is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words models have  two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering  of the words and they also ignore semantics of  the words. For example, "powerful," "strong"  and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper,  we propose an unsupervised algorithm that learns  vector representations of sentences and text documents. This algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict  words in the document. Its construction gives our  algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that our technique outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for  text representations. Finally, we achieve new  state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},

  abstract  = {The simplicity of an idea has long been regarded as a sign of elegance and, when shown to coincide with accuracy, a hallmark of profundity. In this thesis our ideas are vectors used as predictors, and sparsity is our measure of simplicity. A vector is sparse when it has few nonzero elements. We begin by asking the question: given a matrix of n time series (vectors which evolve in a "sliding" manner over time) as columns, what are the simplest linear identities among them__ __ Under basic learning assumptions, we justify that such simple identities are likely to persist in the future. It is easily seen that our question is akin to finding sparse vectors in the null space of this matrix. Hence we are confronted with the problem of finding an optimally sparse basis for any vector space. This is a computationally challenging problem with many promising applications, such as iterative numerical optimization, fast dimensionality reduction, graph algorithms on cycle spaces, and of course the time series work of this thesis. In part I, we give a brief exposition of the questions to be addressed here: finding linear identities among time series, and asking how we may bound the generalization error by using sparse vectors as hypotheses in the machine learning versions of these problems. In part II, we focus on the theoretical justification for maximizing sparsity as a means of learning or prediction. We'll look at sample compression schemes as a means of correlating sparsity with the capacity of a hypothesis set, as well as examining learning error bounds which support sparsity. Finally, in part III, we'll illustrate an increasingly sophisticated toolkit of incremental algorithms for discovering sparse patterns among evolving time series.},
