  abstract = {A transformation technique is presented to minimize soil brightness influences from spectral vegetation indices involving red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. Graphically, the transformation involves a shifting of the origin of reflectance spectra plotted in NIR-red wavelength space to account for first-order soil-vegetation interactions and differential red and NIR flux extinction through vegetated canopies. For cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. var DPI-70) and range grass (Eragrosticslehmanniana Nees) canopies, underlain with different soil backgrounds, the transformation nearly eliminated soil-induced variations in vegetation indices. A physical basis for the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) is subsequently presented. The SAVI was found to be an important step toward the establishment of simple °lobal” that can describe dynamic soil-vegetation systems from remotely sensed data.},

This article explores the performance of combining linear support vector machines with various feature ranking methods, and reports the experiments conducted when participating the Causality Challenge. Experiments show that a feature ranking using weights from linear SVM models yields good performances, even when the training and testing data are not identically distributed. Checking the difference of Area Under Curve (AUC) with and without removing each feature also gives similar rankings. Our study indicates that linear SVMs with simple feature rankings are effective on data sets in the Causality Challenge.},
