# MSU thesis/dissertation/comprehensive exam LaTeX template

This is an ever-so-slightly modified version of the [MSU dissertation template maintained by Prof. Mark Owkes](https://bitbucket.org/markowkes/msu-latex/wiki/Home).

Changes include:
- using biblatex instead of bibtex for references
- a `compexam` option that simply replaces "dissertation" with "comprehensive exam" in the frontmatter
- a `copyrightcc` option that puts your document under a [Creative Commons BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.

For information about the class/template, see Prof. Owkes' bitbucket page and the documentation comments in `main.tex` and `MSUstyle.cls`.
